This package can create URLs with a limited lifetime. This is done by adding an expiration date and a signature to the URL.

```php
$urlSigner = new Sha256UrlSigner('randomkey');

$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);

// => The generated url will be valid for 30 seconds
```

This will output a URL that looks like `https://myapp.com/?expires=xxxx&signature=xxxx`.

Imagine mailing this URL out to the users of your application. When a user clicks on a signed URL
your application can validate it with:

```php
// returns `true` if valid, `false` if not
$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=xxxx&signature=xxxx');
```

## Installation

The package can installed via Composer:
```
composer require spatie/url-signer
```

## Usage

A signer-object can sign URLs and validate signed URLs. A secret key is used to generate signatures.

```php
use Spatie\UrlSigner\Sha256UrlSigner;

$urlSigner = new Sha256UrlSigner('mysecretkey');
```

### Generating URLs

Signed URLs can be generated by providing a regular URL and an expiration date to the `sign` method.

```php
$expirationDate = (new DateTime())->modify('10 days');

$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', $expirationDate);

// => The generated url will be valid for 10 days
```

If an integer is provided as expiration date, the URL will be valid for that amount of seconds.

```php
$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);

// => The generated URL will be valid for 30 seconds
```

### Validating URLs

To validate a signed URL, simply call the `validate()` method. This will return a boolean.

```php
$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=a479abde194d111022a6831edbda29b14e7bdb760438a8a0be2556cd1a6c23fa');

// => true

$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=a479abde194d111022a6831edbda-INVALID-29b14e7bdb760438a8a0be2556cd1a6c23fa');

// => false
```

## Writing custom signers

This packages provides a signer that uses SHA256 to generate signature. You can create your own
signer by implementing the `Spatie\UrlSigner\Contracts\UrlSigner`-interface. If you let your signer extend
`Spatie\UrlSigner\AbstractUrlSigner` you'll only need to provide the `createSignature`-method.

## Tests

The tests can be run with:

```
composer test
```

## Integrations

To get started quickly in Laravel you can use the [spatie/laravel-url-signer](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-url-signer) package.
